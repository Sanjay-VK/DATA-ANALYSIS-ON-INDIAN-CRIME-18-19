# Indian Crime Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing crime data in India using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. By leveraging tools like Python and Power BI, it aims to make complex data more understandable and provide meaningful insights that can assist in better decision-making and policy formulation.

## Features
- Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data.
- Data visualizations for easy interpretation of crime trends.
- Identification of patterns and correlations in crime data.
- Use of tools like Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and Power BI.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: For data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards
